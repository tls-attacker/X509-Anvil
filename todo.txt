- what about keys?	
	- add ec keys in config
	- write generator in protocol attacker !!!!!
	
- extension tests
- update all tests to use new modifiers

- fix asn.1-attacker to be able to consider context specific tags

- what about intermediate config always being 0?

- reimplement certificate generation (probably already done? check if keys are copied correctly)
- move chain config to attacker (not too important rn)
