- copy subject keys as issuer keys to lower certificate
- implement correct key generation using keys in attacker... especially for dsa and ecdsa

- check for hash and signature algorithm support in conjunction and set both at the same time if supported

- extension tests
- update all tests to use new modifiers

- fix asn.1-attacker to be able to consider context specific tags

- what about intermediate config always being 0?

- reimplement certificate generation (probably already done? check if keys are copied correctly)
- move chain config to attacker (not too important rn)
